# Customer Segmentation Analysis  

## Project Overview 🎯  
This project clusters mall customers into distinct segments using K-Means to identify high-value groups based on income and spending habits.  

## Tools Used 🛠️  
- **Python**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
- **Google Colab**  
- **Dataset**: [Mall Customers](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)  

## Key Insights 📊  
- Discovered **5 customer segments**: High-Rollers, Budget Shoppers, Career-Focused Spenders, etc.  
- High-income customers don’t always spend the most.
